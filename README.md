# Minimal Disks Simulation



This codebase was intended to simulate the motion of disks in a box, but it was not functional.



The first step in rectifying this was to recreate and re-reference the header files, along with re-adding a missing member function.





re-referenced system.h in main.cpp; system.cpp, readded missing member function from system.cpp, recreated system.h from the ref. manual, improved documentation in these files, updated progress in README.md


readded missing member function from disk.cpp, recreated disk.h from the ref. manual, improved documentation in these files.
